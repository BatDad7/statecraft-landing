### SNAP ELECTION DEPLOYMENT: UK DISSOLVES PARLIAMENT

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has exercised executive prerogative to dissolve Parliament and schedule a surprise general election for July 4, creating an immediate stress test for the Westminster model. This maneuver underscores the structural distinction of parliamentary systems, where the fusion of powers allows the executive to strategically weaponize election timing against polling deficits. Analysts must monitor this high-risk gamble as a live case study in retrospective voting theory and the stability of uncodified constitutional conventions.

DISCUSSION PROMPT

"Discussion: How does 'Summer Session: Global Events' relate to the current news cycle?"

DEPLOYED IN DEPARTMENTS AT:


## FROM TEXTBOOK TO COMMITTEE FLOOR

Move beyond theory. Give them the roles, the incentives, and the gridlock.


### Legislative Gridlock

Students don't just pass bills; they face the filibuster, committee gatekeeping, and the whip count. Efficiency is the enemy.


### Judicial Review

The Supreme Court player isn't a referee—they shape policy by ruling on the constitutionality of every student-passed act.


### Public Opinion Tracking

Real-time polling data forces Representatives to balance their conscience against the 'median voter' in their simulated district.


## ACADEMIC RIGOR MEETS POLITICAL REALITY.

"I use the Debrief Presentation as 25% of their grade. The insights they share about the difficulty of coalition building are profound."

DEPT. OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, STATE UNIVERSITY

"It solves the 'Free Rider' problem in group work. The simulation incentives force every student to lobby, trade, and vote to survive."
