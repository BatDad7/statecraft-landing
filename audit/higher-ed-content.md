### SNAP ELECTION DEPLOYMENT: UK DISSOLVES PARLIAMENT

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has exercised executive prerogative to dissolve Parliament and schedule a surprise general election for July 4, creating an immediate stress test for the Westminster model. This maneuver underscores the structural distinction of parliamentary systems, where the fusion of powers allows the executive to strategically weaponize election timing against polling deficits. Analysts must monitor this high-risk gamble as a live case study in retrospective voting theory and the stability of uncodified constitutional conventions.
